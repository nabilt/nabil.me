<p>Update: Project is posted on <a href="https://github.com/nabilt/nRF8001-Breakout-Board">GitHub</a></p>
<p>One thing I always need for my hardware projects — whether I'm working on <a href="http://www.nabiltewolde.com/2011/11/home-energy-prototypes.html">sensors for the home</a> or a <a href="http://www.nabiltewolde.com/2011/11/bike-computer-v01-build.html">fitness device</a> — is a low power, cross-platform, and affordable wireless module. I've used HopeRF modules like the <a href="http://www.hoperf.com/rf_fsk/fsk/RFM22B.htm">RFM22B</a> for their affordability and low power capabilities, but because they don't use any standard wireless protocol, I'm forced to make adapters for endpoints like smartphones or computers.</p>
<p>Wireless standards like ZigBee partially solve this problem, but off-the-shelf modules are expensive and still don't help if you want to talk to a smartphone. One might think Bluetooth is the solution then, but in the past, power efficiency and range were a problem if you were building a temperature sensor, for example. Also, you had to be a certified Apple accessory developer if you wanted to make a Bluetooth accessory for the most popular smartphone in the market. Well, all of this has changed with Bluetooth 4.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 4 Low Energy is the latest incarnation of the Bluetooth standard, which most devices released this year will adopt. Bluetooth.com says:</p>
<p><strong>Key features of Bluetooth Low Energy wireless technology include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-low peak, average, and idle mode power consumption  </li>
<li>Ability to run for years on standard coin-cell batteries  </li>
<li>Low cost  </li>
<li>Multi-vendor interoperability  </li>
<li>Enhanced range  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are two reasons why you should be excited by this.<br />
First, this low energy mode means you can use Bluetooth in a range of new applications like home automation, wearable electronics, or anything that needs to log data for long periods of time.<br />
Second, Apple has opened up their Bluetooth API so anyone can create a Bluetooth accessory for iOS 5 and later.</p>
<p>Why did they do this? One reason might be they don't have to worry about developers draining a user’s battery with a poorly made accessory with the new standard. I can't think of any reason to use a different wireless standard for these reasons.</p>
<p>This brings me to my breakout board.<br />
This breakout board is the reference schematic for the Nordic nRF8001 done in Eagle (originally done in Altium by Nordic). It is a simple wireless transceiver with an SPI interface and only a few passive components.</p>
<h3>Why this IC?</h3>
<p>A quick search on major electronic distributor websites shows there are a few manufacturers of Bluetooth 4 chips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Giga — ~$20–$40  </li>
<li>Cambridge Silicon Radio — ~$3  </li>
<li>Nordic Semiconductor — ~$4  </li>
<li>TI — ~$5  </li>
<li>Panasonic — ~$15  </li>
<li>RFM (same one iPhone uses) — ~$40  </li>
</ul>
<p>Parts from Panasonic, Blue Giga, and RFM provide ready-to-go modules, which explains their high price. RFM actually includes Wi-Fi!<br />
Only TI, CSR, and Nordic provide ICs. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>TI is larger and more expensive, offering a complete SoC with an integrated 8051 processor.  </li>
<li>CSR makes you sign an NDA to get the datasheet.  </li>
</ul>
<p>So I chose Nordic because of the IC’s small footprint, open specs, affordability, and simplicity.<br />
Sourcing the parts from Mouser.com, it looks like a populated board should cost ~$12.<br />
Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/nabilt/nRF8001-Breakout-Board/tree/master/bom">BOM</a>.</p>
<p>One thing you should keep in mind: none of these chips are backward compatible with older Bluetooth standards — but that shouldn’t be a problem by the end of 2012.</p>
<p>I plan to send out the board and order the parts this week. Hopefully I can also start working on firmware and a few demo smartphone apps.<br />
